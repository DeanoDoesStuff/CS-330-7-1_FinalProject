How do I approach designing software?
I generally break my problems into smaller and smaller pieces. When writing new functions I try to keep them limited to only one or two things happening within them.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project taught me how to work within frameworks. Each one has its own rules and limitations. It was interesting to learn how OpenGL works under the hood to build out a scene.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I mostly just followed the documentation. Or if their were previous examples I would analyze those to understand how each concept worked, then build it out from there.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Building larger projects will require me to learn more frameworks and API's. I think gaining a greater understanding on how to use the tools at my disposal will take me further to reach that goal.

How did iteration factor into your development?
While learning how each piece of the scene interacted I would adjust one object, then load the scene to see what changed. I would build out this process until I was confortable with my understanding to write out calculations, then commit to them in the code. 

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
I learned about a lot of different properties within OpenGL. Each new addition added new complexity to the scene.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer Science most of all teaches the fundimentals on progromatic thinking. It's a whole new way to think about solving problems. But, breaking them down and iterating over each step is key.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
I haven't settled on which branch of computer science I'd like to focus on just yet. So, I'm unsure right now.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway
More practice in this space is always needed. I can't get any better unless I work on the skills needed to do so.
